            <p>I built a student record system that allows for administrators to manage the students enrolled in their school.  They can add students and search to 
              remove students from the system.  The data is stored in a Microsoft Access Database and can be backed up and exported to an XML file. 
                On launch, the system reads the information into the system from the database and populates the table on screen and populates the tables on screen. 
                For this project, I utilized the <a href="https://www.codejava.net/java-se/jdbc/java-jdbc-example-connect-to-microsoft-access-database" target="_blank">Ucanaccess</a> library to connect my java code to the access database and for the charts and on screen visuals, I used 
                the <a href="https://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> library.  The front end of the system is managed using Java Swing components.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p> The database was manipulated using a database manager class.  This class was a public class used by the front end to load records into the system, 
              enter records into the database, and reset the database for loading.  Within the database class, the createTable() function was responsible for 
              connecting to the database and creating a new table for student records to be inserted.  Before this function is called the dropTable() function must 
              be called to delete the previous Student table. When records need to be inserted into the database, the insertRecord(StudentRecord student) method is 
              called.  Here the student object is accessed to pull the first name, last name, degree status, and degree of study and parsed into a SQL string execute 
              in the database.  Similar to insertion, when a student is searched in the system to be removed from the database the deleteRecord(StudentRecord student) 
              method is called.  The student is then deleted from the database on the condition that the first name, last name, degree status, and area of study match 
              a record in the tables. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The student record java class was used for storing student details in the database.  After being read from the XML file the values are stored in a 
              StudentRecord object, which has a method to return the value of the StudentRecord in the form of a string to be parsed into the database.   
              Standard getters and setters are present in the class to access a specific student record object.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>On load, the application calls on the DatabaseManager class to delete the table currently in database and replace it with a fresh version.  
              After the table is created the front end reads in the XML backup to populate the table in the database.  The system iterates over the values in the 
              XML file and inserts them into the table using the DatabaseManager class.  After the values in the table are loaded, I call a function to initiate 
              the bar chart and the circle chart on screen.  These two functions count the records from the student list on the screen and add their values to the 
              charts and update to the screen.   When adding or deleting a user, on the button clicks the values typed by the end user and parses the information 
              for illegal characters or missing fields.  On successful parsing, the addition button calls the insertRecord(StudentRecord student) and passes in the 
              new student to be added.  With a successful parsing, the deletion button calls the deleteRecord(StudentRecord student) method to begin deleting the 
              record if found in the database.  </p>
