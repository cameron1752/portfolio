            <div class="col">
            <p>I built a discord bot using JavaScript, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.JS</a>, and <a href="https://discord.js.org/#/">Discord.js</a>.  The bot is hosted on an Ubuntu server and configured using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever">forever</a> 
                 With the node.js and discord.js packages in the directory you can start the bot.js file by requiring the discord package.  After declaring that reference, 
                 you can create a new bot client object and set the token received from the discord developer portal.  The bot will need to login using the provided token 
                 before being able to interact with the discord channel.  After I added these lines to my program I added a line to include output when the bot starts and 
                 set the prefix to call the bots functionality.  Add it to your server <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=515265108163952647&permissions=8&scope=bot">here</a></p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Receiving the messages from the discord chat is easy, check the incoming messages for your prefix.  I split the input messages by spaces and always checked the 
                first argument of the returned array.  This would provide a consistent way to ensure it was my bot in the discord channel that is being called.  After I 
                determined if the call to the bot was for my bot, I used the rest of the returned array to determine which function the bot was being called for.  I split 
                these into a switch case statement based on the second array argument to trigger specific functions.    </p>
