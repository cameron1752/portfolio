            <p>The elevator application is a multithreaded program written in Java to simulate people moving amongst a building, all using the elevator.  
              On start the elevator idles at floor 5 of the building until it is called by a user.  Once the elevator is called it begins to travel to where it 
              was called so the passenger can enter.  After the passenger is on the elevator they select the button for the floor they wish to travel to and the 
              elevator takes them to the floor so they can get off.  </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The algorithm used for the elevator considers destination floors and the floor the elevator is called from to choose the shortest path for all 
              passengers of the elevator.  The elevator utilizes a queue system to keep track of all requested passenger calls, checking to ensure the shortest 
              path for each call is made.  The elevator and the passenger classes are synchronized methods and each include error handling and processing.  The 
              elevator object has functions to check the queue for current calls from passengers and managing the call queue.  When the thread is running, the 
              algorithm manages the direction of the elevator based on the call queue and the elevators current floor.  When the elevator is empty and there are 
              not any passengers the elevator defaults to idle at level 5, which can be configured to different floors.   </p>
            <br>
            <p>The person class manages the data for the people of the elevator, providing communication from the front end to the elevator.  The objects have 
              classes to call the elevator and set a destination floor.  Each unique person is given a passenger ID on creation of the object.  </p>
